## Project Introduction

Our group is developing a web-based staff management application designed to streamline job allocation and workload tracking. The application targets businesses that need efficient ways to manage staff availability, workload, and job assignments. Managers will be able to allocate tasks effectively while ensuring staff availability and preferences are considered, ultimately improving organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction.

## Problem and Approach

The core issue we aim to address is the inefficiency in staff workload management and job assignment. Currently, managers may struggle to balance job allocation across teams, consider staff preferences, and prevent overburdening employees. Additionally, staff members may lack clarity on their weekly workload, job preferences, and availabilities.

## Our solution 

provides a platform where:
1. **Managers can easily visualize staff availability and workload, allowing them to make informed job assignments.
2. **Staff can actively manage their availability and job preferences, and view their assignments in advance.
3. **IT administrators can seamlessly manage staff and manager profiles within the system.
